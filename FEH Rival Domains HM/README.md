# FEH Rival Domains
### A script to automate HM farming of the Rival Domains maps in Fire Emblem: Heroes

**requirements**:
- Android
- Tasker
- AutoInput Plugin for Tasker

This script was written to work with the current RD map (as of 8/30/18) and will likely not work perfectly after that. I'll keep this repo updated as I make changes to work with each map.

This is also written to work with my phone (Google Pixel), so the tap coordinates will need to be changed if you have a screen resolution other than 1080x1920. Eventually, I'd like to rewrite the coordinates to use percentages so they're more universally compatible, but there's still no guarantee that it will work without changes on your phone/tablet.
